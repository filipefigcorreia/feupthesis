{\scriptsize \noindent This thesis was typeset on an Apple\textsuperscript{\textregistered} MacBook\textsuperscript{\textregistered} Pro running Mac OS\textsuperscript{\textregistered} 10.6 using the free \LaTeX~typesetting system, originally developed by Leslie Lamport based on \TeX~created by Donald Knuth. The body text is set in Palatino, a large typeface family that began as an old style serif typeface designed by Hermann Zapf and that was initially released in 1948 by the Linotype foundry. Other fonts include Sans, Latin Modern and Typewriter from the Computer Modern family, and Courier, a monospaced font originally designed by Howard Kettler at IBM and later redrawn by Adrian Frutiger. The \LaTeX~style was based on the ones created by Hugo Ferreira and Filipe Correia for their own PhD theses. Most charts were drawn using the \texttt{matplotlib} python library.} \looseness=-1
