# feupthesis

This is a latex template for PhD theses at [FEUP](http://www.fe.up.pt). It is a trimmed down version of the one I have used for my PhD thesis, and was heavily based on the one created by Hugo Ferreira for his thesis.

To compile these sources, just type ``Make`` on the command line. See the [Makefile](Makefile) for additional options.
